# Tasks

Each unit of work is a task file written by the `planner` agent, implemented by `implementer`,
and checked by `reviewer`. Files are public — use generic examples only.

- Spec: `tasks/NNN-short-name.md` (NNN = zero-padded sequence: 001, 002, …)
- Review: `tasks/NNN-review.md` (overwritten on each review round; history is in git)
- Branch: `task/NNN-short-name` → PR → green CI → merge into `master`.

Lifecycle: `planned` → `in-progress` → `in-review` → `done` (or `blocked`). Update `Status` in the spec.
